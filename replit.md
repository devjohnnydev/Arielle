## System Architecture

### Backend Framework
The application is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework that provides flexibility and simplicity for rapid development. Flask was chosen for its minimal setup requirements and excellent documentation, making it ideal for small to medium-sized applications.

**Key Components:**
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database operations, providing an abstraction layer that simplifies database interactions
- **Flask-WTF**: Form handling and CSRF protection, ensuring secure form submissions
- **Werkzeug**: Password hashing and security utilities for admin authentication
- **Session-based authentication**: Simple session management without complex user roles

### Database Design
The system uses SQLAlchemy with a flexible database configuration that defaults to SQLite for development but can be easily switched to PostgreSQL or other databases via environment variables.

**Core Models:**
- **Admin Model**: Simple authentication for the single administrator (Arielle)
- **Order Model**: Comprehensive order tracking including congregation, size, quantity, pricing, payment status, and audit timestamps
- **Automatic calculations**: Total amounts are calculated automatically based on quantity and unit price

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend uses a traditional server-side rendering approach with Jinja2 templates, chosen for simplicity and reduced complexity compared to separate frontend frameworks.

**UI Framework:**
- **Bootstrap 5**: Responsive design framework ensuring mobile compatibility
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for enhanced visual communication
- **Chart.js**: Interactive charts for dashboard analytics
- **Custom CSS**: Church-branded color scheme and styling

### Application Structure
The application follows a modular Flask pattern with clear separation of concerns:

**Core Modules:**
- `app.py`: Application factory and configuration
- `models.py`: Database models and business logic
- `routes.py`: HTTP endpoints and request handling
- `forms.py`: Form definitions and validation rules
- `utils.py`: Helper functions including authentication decorators and data export utilities

### Security Implementation
Security is implemented through multiple layers:
- **Password hashing**: Using Werkzeug's secure password hashing
- **Session management**: Flask's built-in session handling with secret keys
- **Form protection**: CSRF tokens via Flask-WTF
- **Input validation**: Server-side validation for all form inputs

### Data Management Features
The system provides comprehensive data management capabilities:
- **CRUD operations**: Full create, read, update, delete functionality for orders
- **Advanced filtering**: Multi-criteria filtering for orders by congregation, size, payment status
- **Export functionality**: CSV export capability for reporting and external analysis
- **Audit trails**: Created and updated timestamps for all orders

## External Dependencies

### Core Python Packages
